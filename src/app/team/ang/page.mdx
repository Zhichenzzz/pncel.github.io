# Welcome
## let's say something
Something!

Have you ever been on a website where an element “sticks” to the screen and follows you as you scroll down the page? This is what I call a sticky sidebar, and I’ve spent many hours battling with legacy code trying to debug one. In the past, developers used JavaScript to build this feature, by recalculating the position of the sidebar on the browser's scroll event. This was complicated to maintain and also costly for performance.

Recently I was delighted to discover that all major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari) now support the CSS property position: sticky. (Aside from a bug in Chrome with some table elements.) Edge was the final browser to ship support in October 2017 in version 16, which you can check on caniuse.com. This means that we can build a sticky sidebar using just two lines of CSS, with no JavaScript required! Let me show you how.

First set up two divs. One represents the main page content and should extend past the bottom of the screen. The second will be the sidebar, which we'll make shorter than the length of the screen, so we can clearly see it moving in our example. We use flex to position them side-by-side, because it’s 2018 and also because I love flex.

Use the following HTML and CSS:

```
Code block very very very long
