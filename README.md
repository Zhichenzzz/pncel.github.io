# PNCEL's Group Website

## For Group Members

If you wish to add personalized contents to your own page, contact Ang for your member ID. Once you have the member ID, create an [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown w/ embedded JSX) file under [`src/app/team/\[memberId\]`](https://github.com/pncel/pncel.github.io/tree/main/src/app/team/%5BmemberId%5D) with your member ID (i.e., `[memberId].mdx`). Edit the file as you wish, then create a PR/branch and ask Ang to merge it into the main branch.

The website also supports links to your other personal pages, including: your own website, Google Scholar, OrcID, GitHub, LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Youtube. In addition, a short statement can be shown at the team page.

Once we have more publications (or you're welcome to add your pre-UW publications, too!), there is also support to add publications to your own page. Project cards, blogs, news are also planned and will be added some time in the future.
